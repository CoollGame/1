**Introducing the Revolutionary Random Number Generator!**

Are you tired of traditional random number generators? Our program offers a groundbreaking method for generating random numbers using a unique constant derived from the product of Pi and the current date. This innovative approach ensures that no two sets of numbers are ever the same, making it perfect for lottery selections or any other purpose requiring true randomness.

### Key Features:
- **Unique Constant**: Utilizes a specially calculated constant with no analogs in existing methods.
- **True Randomness**: Generates completely unique sets of random numbers every time.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface with easy-to-use buttons for generating 5, 6, or 7 numbers.

### How It Works:
Our generator uses the current date and the mathematical constant Pi to create a base number. This base is then used to produce a set of random numbers, ensuring a truly random and unique result each time.

### Free to Use:
This powerful tool is absolutely free! However, if you appreciate the innovation and find it useful, consider making a donation. If you win using our generator, we kindly ask that you donate a small percentage of your winnings to help us continue developing this project.
